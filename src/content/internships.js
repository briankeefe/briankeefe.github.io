			"Worked collaboratively with five other interns to create a full stack web portal. In order to achieve a polished finished product, our team worked directly with the customer service representatives and established a feedback loop for constant improvements. Once we understood the needs of the user, we designed an interface in .NET Core Razor that queried secure information from a Microsoft SQL database and displayed it in an easy to read manner for customer service representatives. We then deployed this web app to AWS with functioning auto-scaling policy, and implemented end-to-end testing."
